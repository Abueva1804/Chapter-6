# Chapter 6: Using Common Widgets

I’ve learned a lot about using Flutter’s basic widgets, which are the building blocks of any app’s interface. For example, the Scaffold widget gives the app its basic structure, like the top AppBar, the body, and space for other content. The AppBar is where you can add the title of your app or action buttons. The SafeArea widget ensures that the content doesn’t get cut off or overlap with things like the status bar or device notches. I also use the Container widget to add padding, margins, and decoration around elements, making the UI look cleaner. The Text widget is for displaying simple text, while RichText lets me style different parts of the text differently, like mixing bold and italic.

Another important thing I’ve learned is how to use Column and Row widgets to arrange elements in the app. Column stacks items vertically, while Row arranges them horizontally. I can even nest these widgets inside each other to create more complex layouts, depending on how I want things to appear on the screen. Flutter also offers different types of buttons, like flat, raised, or icon buttons, which allow users to interact with the app.

Including images and icons in the UI is also a key part of making the app visually appealing. I learned how to display images using the Image widget and add icons with the Icon widget. I can also customize their size and alignment to fit the layout. Additionally, I’ve used decorators to add extra touches, like borders or shadows, to make widgets look even better. When building forms or input fields, the TextField widget helps users enter data. I’ve learned how to validate that data, check for errors, and give users feedback when needed.
Lastly, I learned how to check the app’s orientation, so the layout adjusts properly whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode. This ensures that the app looks great and works well in any screen orientation. Overall, these basic widgets and techniques are crucial for creating a functional, clean, and interactive Flutter app.
